#This codebook indicates the variables, the data, manipulatation step to the data

1. First to download the data from the https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Then using read.table function to read training data from ./train data and create traindata, traindatay and traindatasub respectively,

same method to test data. 

3. Then merge the train data and test data by using rbind function as the they both have same number of variables, so mergedataxy, mergedatay,mergedatasubject are created. 

4. After that, read the features.txt to only extract the variables that calculate mean() and std() by using grep function 

5. Then assign the names that extract from step4 to mergedataxy, further to eliminate the "_" in the variable name 

6. Read the activity_labels.txt file from the "./data"" folder and store the data in a variable called activity.

7.Clean the activity names in the second column of activity. If the name has an underscore between letters, we remove the underscore and 

8. Transform the values of mergedatay according to the activity data frame.

9.Combine the mergedatasubject,mergedatay,mergedataxy by column to get a new cleaned 10299x68 data frame dataset1, 
The "subject" column contains integers that range from 1 to 30 inclusive; 
the "activity" column contains 6 kinds of activity names

10.Write the dataset1 to merged_data.txt

11.Calucalte the merged_data.txt mean for each activity in each subject, the result is 180 observations and 68 variables 

12 Write the dataset2 to average_meraged_data.txt
